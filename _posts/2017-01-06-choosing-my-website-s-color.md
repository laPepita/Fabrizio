Thanks friends. 

After my first attempt with no plan not going so well I decided that I would actually do a little research.  I did a little searching and I came back with this [article](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/psychology-of-color-and-conversions/ "Psychology of color and conversation").

This helped me decide on the color blue..
>	_"There is wide agreement in the research community on the psychological effects of the color blue. Its subtle message of trustworthiness and serenity is true."_

Now to find some nice shades of blue that you can see and read black on easily.


### Nice fading background
I used CSS3 animations to make that happen.
I faded out the transparent levels of the RGBA pink to a white and ended on white.
It was a little annoying having to put so many frames in otherwise it would come out way too jumpy.
