### Who am I?  That is a great question....

This is what I look like if I wear a suit and look away from the camera.

Otherwise... I look pretty normal in real life.

I really like surfing though and I own a van!  A 2001 Toyota Hiace (370,000 km's and still going).  My Girlfriend thinks that it is going to breakdown but I have faith.

That is all for now!

Speak soon
